# MDS-project

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files for this project, including two code files and ten exported CSV files. The Python code (2024.9 MDS project (main coding).ipynb) involves the complete codes for the project, and the R script (2024.9 MDS project (visualization).R) dedicated to visualising the results.

## Step one
The first step, you can open the Python jupyter notebook file "2024.9 MDS project (main coding).ipynb". When you open this file, my suggestion is to open the navigation pane as the code might be a bit long, which may assist you to have an overview of this project. You can follow the steps: Open the jupyter notebook file > click on the content "View" on the pane above > choose "Table of Contents". You will able to see a directory on the left side. This allows you to navigate through all parts of the code for a thorough review.

## Step two
Next, when you went through all the code blocks of the Python file "2024.9 MDS project (main coding).ipynb", there are ten exported CSV files which refer to the AUC score matrices for each scenario.

## Step three
You may input those CSV files to R studio and open the R script "2024.9 MDS project (visualization).R". This file is used to visualise results, including boxplots of AUC scores for all classifiers and trend graphs.

## The end
Thank you for your visiting and taking time to read this document! Hope this may help you understand and interact with this project effectively.
